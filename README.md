## Weather API in Python

Just playing with an API from open-meteo. Trying not to use too many baked-in solutions. Intended to be a pure CLI program.

### TODO
- Parse output with a clean display
- Show forecast for 7-10 days
- Allow entering a City name as argument

### API: [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs#api_form)

### Libraries Used:
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- [JSON](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
